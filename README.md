### M.V.P  

As a user  
So that I can meet my friends  
I’d like to create an event (title, time, location)  


As a user  
So that I can see the location of everybody in the session  
I’d like to use google maps and pins on the map  


As a user  
So that I can know who is going to be late or not  
I’d like to get a notification given that he/she has an e.t.a later than the event’s time
